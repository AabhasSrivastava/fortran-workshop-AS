# README for VS Code

## Setup

Requirements:

- For Windows: Visual Studio 2022 and [Download here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler-download.html)
- For Linux: CMake >= 2.30 and Intel oneAPI Fortran Essentials  [Download here](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/fortran-compiler-download.html)
- Make sure the oneAPI bin folder is in your `PATH` environment variable (e.g. `C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\compiler\latest\bin`)
- Python 3 [Download here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- Visual Studio Code IDE [Download here](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Start VS Code, and open the folder where you've cloned this project to.

Open the `Extensions` panel on the left (or press `Ctrl + Shift + X`). Then install the following extensions:

- Cmake Tools (provides a UI for interacting with CMake targets)
- Modern Fortran (understands Fortran code and gives code completion based on input from the Fortran Language Server, etc., runs the compiler as a linter)
- Trigger Task on Save (allows auto-formatting with fprettify and running the Fortitude linter on-save)
- EditorConfig for VS Code (automatically deals with whitespacing)
- CTest Lab (integrates CTests with the Test panel so you can run tests in your IDE)

Optional:

- CMake IntelliSense (formatting, auto-complete in CMake configuration)
- Python (helps with writing Python code for the output visualization scripts)

CMake Tools will ask for a "CMake configure preset". Select:

- On Windows, with Visual Studio installed: pick "windows_visual_studio_ifx".
- On Linux, with Intel oneAPI Fortran Essentials installed: pick "linux_make_ifx

## Building and running

From the CMake panel (you'll find an icon on the left of the screen), you can select any of the project's targets that you want to build, run, or debug. The menu (`...`) shows specific actions like Reconfiguring, Rebuilding, Cleaning, etc.

Try, for example, to run `hello-world-tester`. Right-click on the target and press `Set as Launch/Debug Target`. Then press the debug or play icon in the bar at the bottom of the screen.

### Debugging (optional)

Unfortunately, debugging doesn't work out-of-the-box with CMake tools. To Debug, make sure to select a Launch target in the CMake panel on the left. Then choose `Run` -> `Start Debugging`.

The debugger doesn't show the correct contents of variables. To fix this (yes, this is incredibly silly, I just read it [somewhere](https://gist.github.com/albertziegenhagel/6431811950864bd0009b6a1fa78e7f2b)), take the following steps.

- Open this folder, inside your oneAPI installation directory: C:\Program Files (x86)\Intel\oneAPI\debugger\latest\share\ide_support\visual_studio\debugger\vs2022
- Copy the file FEE_VSIX_v17.vsix to your home directory, e.g. C:\Users\noback
- Rename the file to FEE_VSIX_v17.zip, then right-click and `Extract all...`
- Open the extracted folder and create a file in this folder called `.vsdbg-config.json`
- Copy the following text into this file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://aka.ms/vs/vsdbg-config-schema",
  "languages": [
    {
      "languageId": "{8e546c6f-4819-4dde-83dd-f998d52e6f33}",
      "vendorId": "{2a333b19-f91e-477b-8032-22de549d925a}",
      "name": "Fortran",
      "codeViewCompilerIds": [ { "code": 2 } ]
    }
  ]
}
```

- Create a `.cppvsdbg\extensions` in your home directory (e.g. `C:\Users\noback\.cppvsdbg\extensions`).
- Create a file called `FEE.link` in this new directory. The contents should be the full path to the unzipped directory, e.g. `C:\Users\noback\FEE_VSIX_v17`.
- Next time you do a Debug launch, the Debug console panel should show:

```
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
You may only use the C/C++ Extension for Visual Studio Code with Visual Studio
Code, Visual Studio or Visual Studio for Mac software to help you develop and
test your applications.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Loading extensions from 'C:\Users\noback\FEE_VSIX_v17'.
[...]
```

## Fortitude linter

Fortitude will check the file immediately after saving it. Any issues will be reported in the file itself, but also in the `Problems` panel.

To check all files at once, run inside a terminal:

```bash
.\venv\Scripts\fortitude.exe check --fix -- src test
```

## Configuring the Modern Fortran extension

The Modern Fortran extension requires the `fortls` language server, which comes installed with this project as a Python executable. Go to `File` - `Preferences` - `Settings` - `Extensions` - `Modern Fortran` - `Language server`. Make sure to select the `User` tab, not the `Workspace` tab. Then for the setting `Fortran > Fortls: Path` provide the full path to `fortls.exe`, e.g.

```
C:\Users\[location of the repository]\venv\Scripts\fortls.exe
```

(Unfortunately it doesn't work with a relative path)

`fprettify` will be executed on save, and to ensure that the Modern Fortran doesn't try to reformat the code too, we disable formatting under `File` - `Preferences` - `Settings` - `Extensions` - `Modern Fortran` - `Formatting`.
