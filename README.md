# Getting started

Clone this project to your computer using Git (`git clone [url of repository]`). Then pick an option (or do both if you like):

## Option 1: Visual Studio

This option requires less work to set up if you already work with the `delft3d` repository.

See the [README for Visual Studio](docs/README-Visual-Studio.md).

## Option 2: Visual Studio Code

This option has much better support for working with Fortran, but may be less familiar.

See the [README for Visual Studio Code](docs/README-VS-Code.md).
